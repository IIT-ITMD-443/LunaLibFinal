# LunaLibFinal
LunaLib is a virtual library that lets users catalog and track their physical book collections. Users can upload books, view them on visually appealing virtual bookshelves, and explore reading statistics such as completed books, total read, wishlist, in-progress, and unread titles. The project emphasizes both functionality and user-friendly design.
