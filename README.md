# LunaLib - Virtual Personal Library

## Project Overview:

LunaLib is a virtual library that lets users' catalog and track their physical book collections. Users can upload books, view them on visually appealing virtual bookshelves, and explore reading statistics such as completed books, total read, wishlist, in-progress, and unread titles. The project emphasizes both functionality and user-friendly design.

## Lessons Learned:
* Deploying React apps to Azure with CI/CD​
* Handling frontend routing and component structure​
    * Helped me stay organized and made the structure very easy to
maintain​
* Troubleshooting build and repository set up​
    * I had some troubles with the GitHub workflow because it was
different when I was using React​
* Maintaining a clean and organized Git workflow​

## Future Scope:
